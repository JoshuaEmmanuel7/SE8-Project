#   Project Objective

##  Introduction:

1. Singapore - total land area of approximately 728.6 square kilometers (281.3 square miles)
2. Singapore's population is approximately 5.92 million
3. Around 7.54 million daily journeys were made using public transport as of 2022
4. itâ€™s estimated that over 60-70% of the population uses transport-related apps for real-time bus or MRT timings, route planning, or ride-hailing services.

- Nearly 80% of Singapore's population relies on public transport.
- Transportation is the essential tool for everyone

##  Craft a problem statement
1. Many apps provide bus schedules, but they may have delays and are not always accurate. Why?
2. Most apps do not provide a schedule planner function to save the journey itinerary to alert travelers. Why?
3. Most of the app do not have the interaction function to update the real-time status. Why?

##  Why is important to solve?
Reason to resolve the points in above. Need input on the comment. 

##  How to do this will with the app?
This section for us to brainstorming to think about what function in the app can improve and better than other apps
- List of function and how to create the modules?
- Using what technical skill to apply?

#  Modules that we have learned

## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and A Peek Into Product Manager

## Technical and coding Knowledges
  - useState and Hook
  - Context
  - Reducers
  - Conditional rendering
  - React Router
  - Axios (API), Async and useEffect

## How we using the knowledge that we learn to apply on this project

# Project title: Bus Tracking App
  - We must think of a project name
  - Make a "User Stories" presentation in PowerPoint or Google Slide (for presentation use and come out the ideas to structure our project)
  - Plan and Structure for the project UI / UX (color/ how the app looks and etc...)
  - Organise the task and share with each other to working on the modules (Based on the knowledges we learn)
  - Compile all the module into a production app
  - Unit and UAT Testing
  - Public the production code on Website (using Netlify or .... )
